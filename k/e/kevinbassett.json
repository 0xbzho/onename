    "bio": "His passion for music began at an early age by means of beating on pots and pans with hangers. In 1997 he was enlightened by the four/four beat of dance music and turntablelism. His performances on the Electronic Dance Music scene have proven to be original, electric proving  his talent. To this day his performances are rare but prove to magnify the spirit, the true art of performance and push the limits of conceivable music.  Kevin has been creating his own musical compositions since the 1990s. However, his passion for production began to grow around 2000 due to the rise of the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). Due to his newly found abilities in DAW, he began performing live sets from his computer and releasing his music underground around 2001. Notable projects as of recent include but are not limited to the release of ”Techno Seed” in 2010 and the John Legend & The Roots “Shine” remix project of which Kevin received honorable mentions for in 2011. John Legend & The Root’s original composition of “Shine” snagged a Grammy for Best R&B Song in 2011.",
