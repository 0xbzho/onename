    "description": "I've traveled this universe alone, quitely, minding myself as i observed everything that i could. For a time i even was in a situation that not a soul has ever endured in the known universe. After suffering through pain, through torture. through something that does not even have a word to describe it. Comming out the other side, a new man. A new person. It is time, time to succeed in this world. Time to push the limits and learn the knowlege that must be known. It is time to rise up. It is time to inspire the the earth that we reside on and make the world a better place.",
