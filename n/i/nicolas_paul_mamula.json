    "bio": "Fox. Listen to me. Sit cross legged, half or full lotus if you can. Sit up straight from the very base of your spine. Musculature engaged, fore and aft, sides as well. Rest a single moment, adjust accordingly, ever finer, then breathe in deep, push your lungfuls of air into your abdomen and hold, hold, hold, release. All the way out, then hold and invite the contents of your abdomen into your chest cavity and hold, hold, hold. Repeat. Enjoy. Love, Nicolas",
