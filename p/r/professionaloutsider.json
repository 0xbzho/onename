    "bio": "I will fuel your energy, inspire creativity, create magic, add some spark and boost your ambitions. I will shift your way of thinking and help you strike the right balance. I will simplify your life and your business, untangle your thoughts and always return to the essentials.   I am an enterprising spirit and will encourage you to discover your skills – to take initiative and be resourceful. I motivate, inspire, coach, write (columns, and I am now working on my first novel), stimulate, consult and guide people and brands on a strategic level. I might take on a marketing communication job when it tugs on my heartstrings. Only if it is complex enough though. Simple things tend to make me fall asleep.    My mission? Dreaming up ideas. Ideas that make people wonder why nobody has thought of them before. My driving force? To make the world a better place.    Everything I do, always leads to growth. Brands evolve, revenues and sales increase, brand awareness rises, creativity and ingenuity are lifted, image is boosted, clients and companies move forward and people thrive. And yes: it also strengthens me. Growth, to me, is mostly about added value, it’s not just about the money.   I am good at:   • Observing & analysing • Connecting & building bridges • Inspiring & motivating • (Supporting) start-ups & fuelling launches • Rebellious and disruptive thinking  • Coaching (teams and individuals) • Recognizing opportunities • Simplifying things • Getting-up-and-go  On a strategic level I am involved in:   • Branding & identity • Business strategy & business planning • Positioning and propositions • (new) Business models • New business development • Revitalising brands • Marketing & Sales   On a creative & conceptual level I occupy myself with:   • Copywriting • Creative Direction • Campaign development • Social Media / Content strategy • Branding • Visual Identity  What fascinates me to a fault and what I know a lot about:   • Productivity • Design thinking • Behavioural design • Lean Start Up • Advertising • Quantified Self",
